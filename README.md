# Dustin Lind CMC Senior Thesis Repository

Welcome to my code repository for my CMC economics senior thesis.

Please email me at dustinlind99@gmail.com if you have any questions or suggested changes to my analysis.

The data that I will be using is from CRSP/Compustat merged dataset. Due to Github's file size limits, I cannot upload the datasets that I used directly to this repository. Here I have provided the links to the annual fundementals and monthly security data that I will be using: [CRSP/Compustat Merged](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/get-data/center-research-security-prices-crsp/annual-update/crspcompustat-merged/)
